List biological pathways or biological processes that are likely to have a majority of genes: {genes} and your confidence low, medium, or high. Use the following JSON schema:

```json
{{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {{
            "p": {{
                "type": "string",
            }},
           "confidence": {{
                "type": "string",
                 "enum": ["low", "medium", "high"]
            }}
        }},
        "required": ["p","confidence"]
    }}
}}
```
The field `p` is a biological pathway or biological process that might involve multiple genes from this gene list: {genes}. Do not repeat the same biological process or pathway name. Place the output in a JSON code block. Do not add any comments in the JSON code block.
