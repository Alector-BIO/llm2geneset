List {n_pathways} biological pathways, biological processes, or cellular components that contain the following genes """{genes}""" with high confidence. Be as specific as possible. Use the following JSON schema:
```json
{{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {{
            "p": {{
                "type": "string",
            }},
        }},
        "required": ["p"]
    }}
}}
```
Example output will look like the following:
```json
[{{"p":"bp or pathway 1"}},
 {{"p":"bp or pathway 2"}},
 {{"p":"bp or pathway 3"}},
 {{"p":"bp or pathway 4"}},
```
The element `p` designates a pathway, biological process or cellular component. Place the output in a JSON code block. Do not add any comments in the JSON code block.
