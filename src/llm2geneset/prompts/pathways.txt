List at least {n} biological pathways or biological processes that are likely to have a majority of genes that are more highly expressed in {cond1} than in {cond2}. Also provide the reason they might be associated with a pathway or process.
Use the following JSON schema:
```json
{{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {{
            "p": {{
                "type": "string",
            }},
            "r": {{
                "type": "string",

            }}
        }},
        "required": ["p", "r"]
    }}
}}
```
The field `p` is a biological pathway or biological process that might have genes that are more highly expressed in {cond1} than in {cond2}. The field `r` is a reason why the biological pathway or biological process might be enriched in genes more highly expressed in {cond1} than in {cond2}. Do not repeat the same biological process or pathway name.
