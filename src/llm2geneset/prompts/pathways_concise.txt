List at least {n} biological pathways or biological processes that are likely to have a majority of genes that are more highly expressed in {cond1} than in {cond2}.
Use the following JSON schema:
```json
{{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {{
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {{
            "p": {{
                "type": "string",
            }},
        }},
        "required": ["p"]
    }}
}}
```
The field `p` is a biological pathway or biological process that might have genes that are more highly expressed in {cond1} than in {cond2}. Do not repeat the same biological process or pathway name.
