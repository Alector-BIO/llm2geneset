      "**LLM self-assessed confidence:** 0.85  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Calcium Signaling**: Calcium ions (Ca²⁺) serve as a ubiquitous signal in many physiological processes. Calcium binding proteins such as CALM1, CALM2, and CALM3 (calmodulin) modulate various enzymes and channels. The interaction with proteins like ITPR1, ITPR2, and ITPR3 facilitates the release of intracellular calcium stores. Additionally, calcium/calmodulin-dependent kinases (CAMK2A, CAMK2B, CAMK2D, CAMK2G) further transduce the calcium signal to phosphorylate target proteins.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MAPK Pathway Regulation**: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases (MAPKs) are pivotal in extracellular signal transduction. MAPK10, MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, and MAPK14 are key players in the MAPK pathway, influencing cellular responses such as gene expression, mitosis, differentiation, and cell survival/apoptosis. MAP2K3 and MAP2K6 act upstream to activate the MAPKs.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **PRKC/MAPK Crosstalk**: Protein Kinase C (PKC) isoforms (PRKCA, PRKCB, PRKCG, PRKCH, PRKCE, PRKCQ) interact with MAPK pathways to amplify or modulate cellular responses. PRKCs phosphorylate a diverse range of substrates involved in cellular signaling related to growth, apoptosis, and immune responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Adenylate Cyclase and cAMP Pathway**: Adenylate cyclases (ADCY1, ADCY2, ADCY3, ADCY4, ADCY5, ADCY6, ADCY7, ADCY8, ADCY9) convert ATP to cAMP, a crucial secondary messenger. The cAMP pathway interacts with calcium signaling and PRKC pathways, integrating signals to modulate cellular responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Lipase A2 and Pathogen-Associated Molecular Pattern (PAMP) Response**: Phospholipase A2 isoforms (PLA2G4A, PLA2G4B, PLA2G4C, PLA2G4D, PLA2G4E, PLA2G4F) release arachidonic acid, which is a precursor for eicosanoids. These proteins, along with inflammatory cytokines like IL1B, engage in the immune response.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the proteins in this interaction network heavily focus on calcium signaling and its regulation through various kinases and receptors, most notably influencing MAPK pathways and PKC-mediated signaling. These processes are critical for transducing extracellular signals into specific cellular responses, impacting a wide range of cellular functions, including metabolism, immune response, gene expression, and apoptosis.\n"

      "\n",
      "The given system of interacting proteins predominantly functions in the processes of autophagy and mitophagy. Here is a summary of the key grouped functionalities and interactions:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Autophagy Initiation and Regulation:** Proteins like ATG9A, ATG9B, ULK1, AMBRA1, and BECN1 (Beclin-1) are essential initiators and regulators of autophagy. ULK1 is part of a complex that also includes ATG13 and FIP200, which is critical for the initiation of autophagy. Beclin-1 forms a complex with VPS34 (a class III PI3K), which regulates the nucleation of autophagic vesicles.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Mitophagy (Selective degradation of mitochondria):** Proteins such as PINK1 and PRKN (Parkin) are crucial for mitophagy. PINK1 accumulates on damaged mitochondria to recruit the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRKN, which promotes the degradation of defective mitochondria. BNIP3, BNIP3L, and FUNDC1 are also involved as mitophagy receptors that mediate the selection of damaged mitochondria for degradation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ubiquitin-Proteasome Pathway:** The ubiquitin enzymatic cascade, involving ubiquitin (UBC, UBB, UBA52) and deubiquitinating enzymes such as USP8, USP30, and USP15, is critical for tagging proteins for degradation, thus linking it to both proteostasis and autophagy. SQSTM1 (p62) bridges ubiquitinated proteins to the autophagic machinery.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transcriptional Regulation of Autophagy:** Transcription factors such as TFEB, MITF, TFE3, and FOXO3 orchestrate the transcription of autophagy-related genes. TFEB and TFE3, in particular, are master regulators that drive the expression of genes involved in the autophagy-lysosome pathway when activated.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Membrane Dynamics and Fusion Events in Autophagy:** Proteins like RAB7A, RAB7B, and various members of the MAPK family (MAPK8, MAPK9, MAPK10) contribute to the dynamics of membrane trafficking necessary for autophagosome formation and maturation. MFN1, MFN2, and FIS1 are involved in mitochondrial dynamics, which are crucial for mitophagy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Stress Response**: Proteins like TP53 (p53), ATF4, and HIF1A play roles in cellular stress responses and can modulate autophagic and mitophagic processes under conditions of cellular stress or damage, thus linking these processes to broader stress response networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Interplay with Apoptosis**: BCL2 family members, particularly BCL2L1, BCL2L13, and BNIP3, link the regulation of autophagy/mitophagy with apoptosis, suggesting switch mechanisms between cell survival and death pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this protein set is intricately connected to the pathways regulating both general autophagy and the specialized mitophagy process, ensuring cellular homeostasis and quality control of organelles.\n",

These interleukins and their receptors play critical roles in initiating and regulating immune responses by promoting T-cell differentiation, B-cell activation, and inflammatory responses. CD molecules like CD4, CD8A, CD8B, and CD3 (G, E, D subunits) are essential for T-cell mediated responses, differentiating helper and cytotoxic T-cells. HLA class II molecules (HLA-DQA1, HLA-DQB1, HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1) are crucial for antigen presentation and triggering adaptive immune responses.\n",

      "1. **Receptor-mediated signaling:** A crucial component is various growth factors and their receptors (e.g., EGF, EGFR, FGFs, FGFRs, PDGFs, PDGFRs, VEGFs, VEGFRs). These combinations initiate signaling cascades upon ligand binding, playing pivotal roles in processes like angiogenesis, cell proliferation, differentiation, and motility.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **MAPK signaling:** Members of the MAPK family (e.g., MAPK11, MAPK12, MAPK13, MAPK14, MAPK1, MAPK3) are integral to relaying extracellular signals to intracellular targets, regulating diverse cellular activities including inflammatory response, stress response, and apoptosis through phosphorylation events.\n",

      "4. **Integrin signaling and cytoskeletal dynamics:** Integrins (e.g., ITGB1, ITGB2, ITGB3) and associated signaling proteins (e.g., TLN1, TLN2, PFN1, PFN2, PFN3, PFN4, VASP) are key in mediating cell adhesion and movement, which involve remodeling of the actin cytoskeleton. This is complemented by small GTPases (e.g., RHOA, RAC1, CDC42) that control actin cytoskeleton dynamics, ensuring coordinated cell movement and adhesion processes.\n",
