      "\n",
      "1. **TGF-beta Ligands and Receptors:** TGFB1, TGFB2, and TGFB3 are the key TGF-beta signaling molecules. TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 are their respective receptors that initiate the signaling cascade upon ligand binding.\n",
      "   \n",
      "2. **BMP Ligands and Receptors:** BMP2, BMP4, BMP5, BMP6, BMP7, BMP8A, BMP8B are members of the BMP family that bind to BMP type I receptors (BMPR1A, BMPR1B) and BMP type II receptor (BMPR2) to initiate BMP signaling pathways. ACVR1, ACVR1B, ACVR1C, ACVR2A, and ACVR2B are activin receptors involved in this process.\n",
      "   \n",
      "3. **SMAD Transcription Factors:** Central to both TGF-beta and BMP pathways are the SMAD family proteins, playing crucial roles in transducing extracellular signals to the nucleus. SMAD2, SMAD3 (TGF-beta signaling) and SMAD1, SMAD5, SMAD9 (BMP signaling) partner with the co-SMAD, SMAD4, to regulate gene expression. Inhibitory SMADs (SMAD6, SMAD7) provide negative feedback to modulate these pathways.\n",
      "   \n",
      "4. **Regulatory Proteins and Co-factors:** SMURF1 and SMURF2 are ubiquitin ligases that mark specific proteins for degradation, thus modulating the signaling intensity. NOG (Noggin), GREM1, and GREM2 are extracellular antagonists that bind BMPs, preventing their interaction with receptors. \n",

      "**LLM Self-assessed confidence:** 0.85\n",
      "\n",
      "The system of interacting proteins is predominantly involved in two broad and interconnected biological processes: inflammation and apoptosis. Several members of this protein set are integral to the initiation and regulation of inflammatory responses, particularly through pathways mediated by cytokines and receptors.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Inflammatory Signaling:** Proteins such as IL1B, IL6, IL18, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, CXCL8, TNF, and their receptors (e.g., TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, and IL12 receptors) play pivotal roles in the inflammatory response. These cytokines and chemokines are critical for recruiting immune cells to sites of infection or injury and initiating the inflammatory cascade, which involves activation of NF-κB subunits (NFKB1, NFKB2, RELA) and adaptation via adaptor proteins such as MYD88. The interplay among these molecules ensures a rapid and robust response to pathogens, facilitating immune cell activation, proliferation, and subsequent pathogen clearance.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Apoptotic Signaling:** Several key proteins, including APAF1, CYCS (cytochrome c), PYCARD, CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, and BCL2 family members (BCL2L13, BNIP3), are closely associated with apoptosis. These proteins form part of the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways, where they regulate cell death in response to intracellular stress and extrinsic signals. The coordination between the apoptotic caspases and the upstream regulators like APAF1 and CYCS signifies a tightly controlled mechanism ensuring that damaged or infected cells are efficiently eliminated to maintain cellular homeostasis and prevent the spread of infection.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Molecular Chaperones and Co-Chaperones:** A subset of proteins, including HSPA family members (HSPA1A, HSPA1B, HSPA2, HSPA6, HSPA8, HSPA1L) and HSPD1, are involved in protein folding, stress responses, and modulation of the apoptotic pathways. These chaperones assist in the correct folding of newly synthesized proteins and in the refolding or degradation of misfolded proteins, particularly during cellular stress conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Regulation by Transcription Factors:** HSF1 is a pivotal transcription factor for the heat shock response, activating the expression of heat shock proteins (e.g., HSP70 family). NF-κB subunits (RELA, NFKBIA) are downstream effectors in the inflammatory response, directly regulating the transcription of inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, and other immune-related genes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, this system integrates signals from various stimulus-responsive pathways to elicit a coordinated response aimed at maintaining cellular homeostasis under stress and immune challenge conditions. The reciprocal regulation and interplay of inflammatory mediators and apoptotic factors work to ensure a balanced response to cellular damage and pathogen invasion, minimizing unnecessary tissue damage while effectively addressing the underlying insult.\n"

The proteins in this system primarily consist of various G-protein subunits (GNA, GNB, GNG) and associated regulators such as ARRB (arrestin proteins) and MAPK (Mitogen-activated protein kinases). The G-protein subunits play a critical role in the signaling cascade initiated by G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), which are essential for transmitting extracellular signals into intracellular responses.\n",

This is a critical step in the regulation of numerous physiological processes, including vision, taste, olfaction, and neurotransmission.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Arrestins (ARRB1, ARRB2) are involved in the desensitization and internalization of GPCRs. Upon receptor activation and phosphorylation, arrestins bind to the GPCR, preventing further G-protein signaling and directing the receptor for internalization or alternative signaling pathways such as those involving MAPK.\n",

      "\n",
      "1. **Ribosomal Proteins (RPs)**: The majority of the proteins listed, such as RPL22, RPL21, RPL11, RPS8, RPS9, and RPS7, are integral components of the ribosomal subunits. These proteins function coordinately to facilitate the assembly and structural stability of the ribosome, enabling efficient protein synthesis. Proteins like RPL5, RPL11, and others in the large subunit (60S) often play roles in the peptidyl transferase center, ensuring correct peptide bond formation and elongation. Small subunit proteins (e.g., RPS8, RPS9) are critical for mRNA decoding and ensuring the fidelity of translation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Eukaryotic Initiation Factors (eIFs)**: Proteins such as EIF1AX, EIF3A, EIF3L, and others in the system are components of the eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) complex. This complex plays a crucial role in the initiation phase of translation by mediating the recruitment of mRNA and methionyl-tRNA to the small ribosomal subunit, forming a pre-initiation complex. Additionally, eIFs help in scanning the mRNA for the start codon and facilitate the joining of the 60S subunit to form a complete 80S ribosome poised for elongation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Proteins involved in ribosome-related processes**: Proteins like UBA52, which is linked to ubiquitin-conjugation pathways, indicate the involvement of ribosomal protein ubiquitination, a process important for the regulation of ribosome activity and turnover.\n",

      "The system of interacting proteins predominantly revolves around adipogenesis and metabolic regulation, showcased by the following critical components and their interactive dynamics:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Adipogenic Transcription Factors**: Proteins such as PPARG, CEBPA, CEBPB, and CEBPD are central to adipogenesis, regulating the differentiation of pre-adipocytes into mature adipocytes. These transcription factors form complex feedback loops and interactions that ensure a cohesive regulatory network for adipocyte differentiation.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Nuclear Co-activators and Co-repressors**: NCOA1, NCOA2, NCOA3, NCOR1, and NCOR2 act in tandem to modulate the activity of transcription factors involved in metabolic processes. Their function is essential in fine-tuning the transcriptional responses necessary for metabolic homeostasis.\n",

This ensures the precise regulation of gene expression required for adipogenesis and metabolic integration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Signaling Molecules**: TGFB1, TNF, LEP (leptin), and ADIPOQ (adiponectin) represent critical signaling molecules in this system. They are not only involved in adipocyte differentiation but also play significant roles in metabolic regulation, affecting insulin sensitivity, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses.\n",
      "\n",

      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Retinoic Acid Synthesis and Degradation:**\n",
      "   The system includes several enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of retinoic acid, a key regulator of gene expression. ALDH1A1, ALDH1A2, and ALDH1A3 are aldehyde dehydrogenases responsible for converting retinaldehyde to retinoic acid. Conversely, CYP26A1, CYP26B1, and CYP26C1 are cytochrome P450 enzymes that degrade retinoic acid, thus maintaining its levels within a physiological range.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Retinoid-Binding Proteins:**\n",
      "   Cellular retinoic acid-binding proteins (CRABP1, CRABP2) regulate the availability of retinoic acid by binding to it and facilitating its delivery to specific pathways or degradation enzymes. This regulation is crucial for controlling the spatial and temporal availability of retinoic acid during development and in maintaining homeostasis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Retinoic Acid Receptors:**\n",
      "   Retinoic acid exerts its effects primarily through nuclear receptors like RARA, RARB, and RARG, which form heterodimers with RXR receptors (RXRA, RXRB, RXRG). These receptors bind to retinoic acid response elements in the DNA and regulate the transcription of target genes involved in cell differentiation, proliferation, and apoptosis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Alcohol and Retinol Metabolism:**\n",
      "   ADH1A, ADH1C, ADH7, and RDH (RDH5, RDH10, RDH11, RDH13, RDH16) enzyme families are involved in the oxidation and reduction of retinol and retinaldehyde, key steps in the biosynthesis of retinoic acid. These enzymes also play roles in metabolizing various alcohols and contribute to maintaining the balance of retinoid metabolites.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Energy Metabolism and Cellular Regulation:**\n",
      "   Proteins like PDHA1, PDHA2, PDHB, PDHX, PDPK1, DLAT, LDHD, PDK2, PDK3, and PDK4 are integral to the regulation of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, influencing energy metabolism. Although their primary role is in energy homeostasis, the interplay between retinoic acid metabolism and cellular energy balance may indicate cross-regulatory mechanisms.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Receptors and Signal Transduction:**\n",
      "   PPARD and other PPAR family members are involved in lipid metabolism and energy regulation. They potentially intersect with retinoic acid signaling pathways, especially given PPARs' ability to bind to RXR, highlighting the integrated network of transcriptional regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Interconnected Roles in Development and Homeostasis:**\n",
      "   The comprehensive involvement of retinoic acid synthesis, degradation, binding proteins, and receptors emphasizes their collective role in modulating gene expression critical for differentiation, development, and homeostasis. The balance of synthesis and degradation underlies the precise control of retinoic acid levels necessary for these processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the proteins in this system predominantly participate in the synthesis, degradation, and regulatory signaling of retinoic acid. The synergy between retinoid-binding proteins, enzymes involved in retinoid metabolism, and nuclear receptors underscores their collective role in maintaining retinoic acid homeostasis and its diverse physiological effects.\n"

      "**Name:** Regulation of cellular stress responses and apoptosis  \n",
      "**LLM self-assessed confidence:** 0.87\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Role in Stress Response:** Proteins like SIRT1, NFE2L2, and HMOX1 play crucial roles in cellular stress responses. SIRT1 is involved in deacetylating proteins that contribute to cellular regulation, oxidative stress resistance, and mitochondrial function. NFE2L2 (also known as NRF2) is a key transcription factor that induces the expression of various antioxidant proteins that protect against oxidative damage. HMOX1 is an enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of heme to biliverdin, free iron, and carbon monoxide, which assists in reducing oxidative stress levels.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Apoptosis and Autophagy Regulation:** Proteins such as MTOR, SQSTM1 (p62), and MAP1LC3A are central to the processes of autophagy and apoptosis. MTOR is a master regulator of cellular growth and survival, often antagonizing autophagy. SQSTM1 acts as a scaffold protein that can target ubiquitinated proteins for degradation via the autophagy-lysosome pathway, while MAP1LC3A is directly involved in autophagosome formation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Signal Transduction and Transcriptional Regulation:** Various proteins, including CREB1, RAF1, and RELA, are deeply involved in signaling pathways that regulate transcriptional responses to stress and other stimuli. CREB1 is a transcription factor activated via phosphorylation in response to cellular stress, leading to the expression of survival genes. RAF1 is part of the MAPK/ERK pathway, modulating cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis. RELA (a subunit of NF-κB) is crucial for inflammatory responses and cell survival under stress conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Calcium Signaling and Homeostasis:** Proteins such as CALM1, STIM1, CAMK4, and CAMKK2 regulate calcium signaling pathways critical for numerous cellular processes, including muscle contraction, cell proliferation, and stress responses. CALM1 (calmodulin) binds calcium and activates enzymes involved in calcium signaling. STIM1 detects calcium depletion in the endoplasmic reticulum and triggers calcium influx. CAMK4 and CAMKK2 are kinase enzymes activated by calcium/calmodulin binding, which regulate various downstream targets involved in cell survival and stress responses.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Cellular Adhesion and Inflammation:** VCAM1 and ICAM1 are adhesion molecules important in the immune response and inflammation. These molecules mediate the adhesion of leukocytes to endothelial cells and play roles in signaling pathways that can lead to cellular activation and survival or apoptosis under conditions of stress.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Metabolic and Mitochondrial Regulation:** Proteins such as TSC1, SIRT1, and DNM1L regulate metabolic processes and mitochondrial function. TSC1 (hamartin) is part of the TSC1/2 complex that controls MTOR activity, linking nutrient availability to cell growth. DNM1L (Drp1) is involved in mitochondrial fission, crucial for maintaining mitochondrial integrity and function during cellular stress conditions.\n",

      "1. **DNA Damage Sensing and Repair:** Several of the listed proteins, such as ATM, ATR, MDC1, RAD50, MRE11, NBN, and RAD51, are crucial components of the DNA damage response. They detect DNA damage and facilitate repair mechanisms like homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining. Proteins like H2AX and TP53BP1 participate in signaling and chromatin modifications that signal the occurrence of DNA damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Cell Cycle Checkpoints:** CDC25A, CDC25C, CDK1, CDK2, CCNE1, and CCNB1 are key regulators of cell cycle progression. CHEK1 and CHEK2 are checkpoint kinases that halt the cell cycle in response to DNA damage, ensuring the cell does not proceed to mitosis before the damage is repaired. The interaction between these cell cycle regulators and DNA repair proteins ensures that cells maintain genomic integrity.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Apoptosis and Cell Fate Determination:** Proteins like TP53, TP73, CASP2, BID, CRADD, and PIDD1 are involved in deciding cell fate post-DNA damage. TP53 and TP73 can lead to cell cycle arrest, senescence, or apoptosis, depending on the extent of damage and cellular context, providing a pivotal link between DNA damage response and apoptotic pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transcription Regulation and Stress Response:** JUN, CREB1, NFKBIA, and ATF2 modulate gene expression in response to stress signals, including DNA damage. TP53 and MDM2/MDM4 form a regulatory feedback loop crucial for controlling p53 activity post-DNA damage.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Chromatin Remodeling and Maintenance:** BRCA1, FANCD2, and SMC1A are involved in maintaining chromatin structure and integrity, which is essential for both the repair of DNA damage and the regulation of cell cycle checkpoints.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Other Significant Interactions:** ABL1, IKBKG, MAPK9, and RIPK1 tie signal transduction pathways to the cellular stress response, possibly influencing both survival and apoptosis pathways.\n",
      "\n",
      "To summarize, this system of proteins integrates DNA damage sensing and repair with cell cycle control, ensuring that cells either repair their DNA or undergo apoptosis if the damage is beyond repair. This coordinated response is crucial for maintaining genomic integrity and preventing tumorigenesis.\n",

      "**LLM self-assessed confidence:** 0.87\n",
      "\n",
      "The provided system of interacting proteins appears to heavily involve the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, which is a critical regulator of cell growth, proliferation, metabolism, and survival. Key proteins within this system contribute to the mTORC1 pathway and other interconnected signaling networks that modulate these cellular activities.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **mTORC1 Pathway Core Components:** MTOR, RPTOR, MLST8, and DEPTOR are core components of the mTORC1 complex. MTOR serves as the catalytic subunit, while RPTOR (Raptor) is crucial for substrate recognition. MLST8 interacts with MTOR to stabilize the complex, and DEPTOR is an inhibitor that regulates MTOR activity, indicating a tightly controlled signaling cascade.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Upstream Regulators:** Proteins such as TSC1, TSC2, and AKT1S1 (PRAS40) are crucial upstream regulators of mTORC1 activity. TSC1 and TSC2 form a complex that inhibits RHEB, a GTPase that activates MTOR under nutrient and growth factor-rich conditions. AKT1S1, a downstream target of the PI3K/AKT pathway, can inhibit TSC2, thereby promoting mTORC1 activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Cell Cycle and Proliferation:** Proteins like CDK4, CDK6, CCND1 (Cyclin D1), RBL1 (p107), RBL2 (p130), TFDP1, and TFDP2 are involved in cell cycle progression, particularly the G1 to S phase transition. E2F transcription factors (E2F4, E2F5), which are regulated by RBL proteins, play important roles in the expression of genes required for cell proliferation.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Transcriptional Regulation and Apoptosis:** TP53, a crucial tumor suppressor, and CASP3 and CASP9, which are involved in apoptosis, are also part of this system. This inclusion suggests a balance between cell proliferation and programmed cell death.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Notch Signaling Interplay:** The Notch signaling components (NOTCH1, DLL1, HES1, HES5), along with regulators like PSEN1 and PSENEN, interconnect with mTORC1 signaling, impacting cell fate determination and differentiation processes.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Nutrient and Energy Sensing:** SIRT1 and FOXO1, which are involved in nutrient sensing and energy homeostasis, influence mTORC1 activity and cellular metabolism. SIRT1 deacetylates and activates FOXO transcription factors, promoting stress resistance and metabolic regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Protein Synthesis and Degradation:** Components like EIF2B5 and GSK3B are involved in translation initiation and glycogen metabolism, respectively, and link to mTORC1 through protein synthesis regulation.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Epigenetic Regulation:** Proteins such as H3-3A and RBBP4 (a subunit of the histone deacetylase complex) suggest a connection between mTORC1 signaling and chromatin remodeling.\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, this protein interaction system is predominantly associated with the mTORC1 signaling pathway and its extensive role in cell growth, proliferation, metabolic regulation, and integration with other signaling pathways such as those controlling apoptosis and cell cycle progression. The integration of various signaling pathways underscores the comprehensive control over cellular metabolism and growth.\n",

      "2. **MAVS (Mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein):** MAVS is a critical adaptor protein located on the mitochondrial membrane. Upon activation by RIGI, MAVS forms large prion-like aggregates that act as signaling platforms to recruit downstream effectors such as TRAF6 and TRAF3. MAVS activation leads to the downstream activation of TBK1 and IKBKE.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **TBK1 (TANK-binding kinase 1) and IKBKE (IκB kinase ε):** Both TBK1 and IKBKE are kinases that phosphorylate and activate transcription factors like IRF3 and IRF7. Their activation is crucial for the production of type I interferons such as IFNB1.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **IRF3 (Interferon regulatory factor 3):** IRF3 is a transcription factor activated by phosphorylation through TBK1 and IKBKE. Activated IRF3 translocates to the nucleus where it promotes the transcription of type I interferons, including IFNB1.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **IFNB1 (Interferon beta):** IFNB1 is a type I interferon essential for the antiviral response. It is secreted and acts in an autocrine and paracrine manner to amplify the antiviral state in infected and neighboring cells by inducing the expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs).\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **TRAF6 (TNF receptor-associated factor 6) and TRAF3 (TNF receptor-associated factor 3):** TRAF6 and TRAF3 are E3 ubiquitin ligases that play roles in the activation of the NF-κB pathway and the production of type I interferons upon MAVS activation.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **TOMM70 (Translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 70):** TOMM70 binds to MAVS and enhances the RIGI-MAVS signaling pathway. It also facilitates the recruitment of TBK1 to MAVS, thereby promoting the antiviral signaling cascade.\n",
