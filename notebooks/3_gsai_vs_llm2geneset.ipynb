      "\n",
      "1. **TGF-β Signaling:** Proteins such as TGFB1, SMAD2, SMAD3, and SMAD4 play critical roles in the TGF-β signaling cascade. Upon ligand binding, TGF-β receptors activate SMAD proteins, which form complexes that translocate to the nucleus to regulate target gene expression. This pathway is pivotal in numerous biological processes including cell growth, differentiation, and apoptosis.\n",

VEGFA also indicates a potential role in angiogenesis, linking these signaling pathways to vascular development and homeostasis.\n",

      "3. **Regulation of Apoptosis and Cell Survival:** Proteins like TNFSF4, TNFRSF18, and TRAF2 are involved in apoptosis signaling and immune response modulation. Their interplay indicates a cross-talk between TGF-β signaling and apoptotic pathways, influencing cell survival in various contexts, including cancer and tissue repair.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Cellular Stress and Protein Homeostasis:** HSPA8 (heat shock protein) suggests a response to cellular stress, which may coordinate with TGF-β signaling to enhance resilience in adverse conditions. Additionally, the presence of ubiquitination components (e.g., RBX1, CUL3) supports a cellular mechanism for regulating the degradation of proteins linked to stress-related responses.\n",

      "5. **Differentiation and Development:** The combination of proteins involved in differentiation (like HES4, HES5) alongside those implicated in muscle and neural development (e.g., MUSK, DLL1) indicates the system's role in developmental processes, modulated by external growth factors including TGF-β.\n",
      "\n",
      "In conclusion, the network of interacting proteins primarily orchestrates TGF-β signaling while also mediating various related processes including cellular stress response, differentiation, and apoptosis. The proteins' interactions reveal a tightly regulated system that balances growth, stress responses, and differentiation, underscoring the complexity and functionality inherent in this protein network. \n",

Central to this system are the Notch receptors (NOTCH1, NOTCH2, NOTCH3, NOTCH4) and their ligands (JAG1, JAG2, DLL1, DLL3, DLL4). The interaction between these receptors and ligands initiates a series of proteolytic cleavages requiring the presenilins (PSEN1, PSEN2), which are part of the gamma-secretase complex that processes the Notch receptors. This cleavage releases the Notch intracellular domain, which translocates to the nucleus and interacts with the transcription factor RBPJ, also known as CSL, along with the co-activators MAML1, MAML2, and MAML3. This complex modulates the expression of target genes, including HES1 and HEY1, which play roles in cell fate determination, differentiation, and proliferation.\n",
